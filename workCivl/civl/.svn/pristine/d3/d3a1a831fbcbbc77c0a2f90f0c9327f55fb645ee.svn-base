/**
 * A State represents the (global) state of a CIVL Model. It encodes:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>a set of process states</li>
 * <li>a set of dynamic scopes</li>
 * <li>a path condition</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * The data listed above comprise the "intrinsic data" of the state. A State may
 * have additional "extrinsic data" but they should not affect the equals or
 * hashCode methods. Those methods should depend only on the three intrinsic
 * data listed above.
 * 
 * States should be immutable (or something in between). The contract for the
 * state modules does not specify this. However, states must supply a "commit"
 * method. After invoking this method, the state must be essentially immutable,
 * which means its intrinsic data (and therefore hash code) cannot change.
 * 
 * 
 * The processes and dynamic scopes are ordered within any one State. However
 * their order may change from State to State.
 * 
 * In addition, States may participate in the Flyweight Pattern. We say two
 * states are equivalent if the <code>equals</code> method says they are equal.
 * (This means they have "equal" intrinsic data; the extrinsic data are
 * completely ignored.) The point of the Flyweight Pattern is to choose one
 * representative State from each equivalence class. This pattern is provided
 * through a method in the StateFactory, {@link StateFactory#canonic(State)}.
 * That method takes any State, and return the State which is the canonic
 * representative of the given State's equivalence class. The canonic State are
 * also given unique "canonic ID numbers".
