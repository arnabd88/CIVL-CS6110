extern, sync, config: aren't these all CVT notions?  

the extent thing seems a little clunky.  It is there only for 
variables of array type.  Would it be better to have
an ArrayVariable which extends Variable?  Or something else?


Explanation of whole interface can be better.   It is a variable,
but maybe say static notion of variable, declared in some static scope,
with a type, there are variable IDs (are these IDs unique only within
the scope, are they numbered from 0..n-1, where n is the number
of variables in the scope, ...)
