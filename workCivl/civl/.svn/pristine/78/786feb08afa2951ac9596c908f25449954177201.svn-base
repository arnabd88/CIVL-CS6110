Done:
  make the args struct
  implement clCreateKernel
  Array with flags in, tells the program what variables are malloc'd or not so they don't try to free the same space
  
  
ToDo:

  
ToDo: Long term:
  Possible implementation of clGetKernelWorkGroupInfo, if an example that needs it is used
  Possible implementation of clGetDeviceInfo
  Re-arrange code so that the group designation is actually possible

Problems:
  This example does not neatly into work already done.
  No memset(); 
  No strcmp();
  Program crash when using array index of kernel
  Bug in memory leak detection
  Forgot to notice that there need to be multiple args

Grappled with invalid pointer dereference.

Alter wiki again

Problems:
  Bug where there are many files that aren't there, and the printing of each file is not there
  Error: This feature is not yet implemented: Pointer addition for anything other than array elements or variables
at f31:24.4-30 "((  int*)(shared) ... ]".
  This kernel really doesn't play nice with CIVL
  heap object names are unique, but not in this program
