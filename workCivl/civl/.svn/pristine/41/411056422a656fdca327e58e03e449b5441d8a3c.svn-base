Add 

DereferenceExpression (*e)
RecordNavigationExpression (e.i, where i is an int)
AddressOfExpression (&e)


Would it make sense to have a subtype LHSExpression of Expression?
VariableExpression, ArrayIndexExpression, RecordNavigationExpression
DereferenceExpression all extend LHSExpression.

Should there be a NullExpression for "null" (the null pointer)?

How about a CastExpression?

pointer arithmetic: p+e or e+p, and p-q.  Need additional binary
operators for those (POINTER_ADD, POINTER_SUBTRACT)?

Can the operands to the numeric expressions hav mixed types?
(real/integer).  I hope not (use casts).
