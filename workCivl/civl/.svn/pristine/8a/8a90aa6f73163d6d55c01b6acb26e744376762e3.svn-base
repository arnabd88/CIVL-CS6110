Why is a ProcessType not a primitive type?

A CIVL Pointer type is supposed to also have an (optional?) additional
scope parameter, which limits the scope into which it can point.

{
  \scope s; /* gives name s to this scope */
  int x;
  ...
  {
    int *\region(s) p = &x;
    ...
  }
}

(If not specified, the default scope used in the root dynamic scope.)

Add to PointerType:
  Scope getRegion();
  void setRegion(Scope scope);


Remove setters from types (except for struct)
