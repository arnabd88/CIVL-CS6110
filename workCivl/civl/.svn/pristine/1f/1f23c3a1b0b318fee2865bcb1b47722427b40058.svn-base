/** 
 * This package handles system functions. It provides interfaces for 
 * evaluating the guard of system function calls, computing enabled 
 * transitions (for various POR) for system function calls, implementing the 
 * semantics (execution) of each system function call. Currently, there are 
 * Library Enabler and Library Executor. Each system library should have 
 * both of them implemented.
