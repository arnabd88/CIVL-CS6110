/*****************************************************************************
* SOURCE: This is a translation of a Pthread program from the Lawrence Livermore
* Computing Center POSIX Threads Programming Exercise at:
* https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/pthreads/exercise.html
* FILE: dotprod_mutex.cvl
* DESCRIPTION:
*   This example program illustrates the use of mutex variables 
*   in a threads program. This version was obtained by modifying the
*   serial version of the program (dotprod_serial.c) which performs a 
*   dot product. The main data is made available to all threads through 
*   a globally accessible  structure. Each thread works on a different 
*   part of the data. The main thread waits for all the threads to complete 
*   their computations, and then it prints the resulting sum.
* Command line execution:
* civl verify -inputNUMTHRDS=4 -inputVECLEN=100000 dotprod_mutex.cvl

The function dotprod is activated when the thread is created.
As before, all input to this routine is obtained from a structure 
of type DOTDATA and all output from this function is written into
this structure. The benefit of this approach is apparent for the 
multi-threaded program: when a thread is created we pass a single
argument to the activated function - typically this argument
is a thread number. All  the other information required by the 
function is accessed from the globally accessible structure.

The main program creates threads which do all the work and then 
print out result upon completion. Before creating the threads,
The input data is created. Since all threads update a shared structure, we
need a mutex for mutual exclusion. The main thread needs to wait for
all threads to complete, it waits for each one of the threads. We specify
a thread attribute value that allow the main thread to join with the
threads it creates. Note also that we free up handles  when they are
no longer needed.
