How to release a new version of CIVL.

1. Check all tests pass.

2. Edit the fields named "version" and "date" in class
edu.udel.cis.vsl.civl.CIVL to use the new version and today's date.

3. Create the tag: to create version 0.2, for example:

svn copy svn://vsl.cis.udel.edu/civl/trunk svn://vsl.cis.udel.edu/civl/tags/0.2

4. Create a new config file for autotest: check out
svn://vsl.cis.udel.edu/scripts if you have not already,
or update it if you already have a local copy.  Create
a new file config_civl-0.2.sh (for example) based on
one of the other config_civl configuration files.  There
are 3 points that must be changed: (1) BRANCH should
be set to 0.2 (for example); this is the name that will
be assigned to this branch, (2) REPO needs to be changed
to point to the new tagged version, e.g.
svn://vsl.cis.udel.edu/civl/tags/0.2, and (3)
WORKER_CONFIG needs to be changed to refer to the 
same configuration file you are creating, i.e.,
${WORKER_SCRIPT_DIR}/config_civl-0.2.sh in this example.
Save this file and commit it.

5. Update the scripts on nikolai:
ssh tester@nikolai.cis.udel.edu
cd repos/scripts/
svn update

6. Log on to vsl.cis.udel.edu, eecise_su svn, and edit
/home/svn/repositories/civl/hooks/post-commit
by changing the second autotest command to refer to the
new version configuration file.  (You could also add
a completely new autotest command; it will work
either way.)

7. Update Trac milestones.
