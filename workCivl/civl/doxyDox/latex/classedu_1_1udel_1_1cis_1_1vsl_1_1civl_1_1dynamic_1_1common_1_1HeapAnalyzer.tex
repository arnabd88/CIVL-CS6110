This class implements operations on a heap.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
This class implements operations on a heap. 

\hyperlink{structA}{A} heap consists of a fixed number (however, the number may vary from models to models) of heap fields, while a heap field is composed of a dynamic number of heap objects of type array of type T. 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item each dyscope has a heap by default, as the 0 variable of that dyscope; 
\item the initial value of a heap is a S\+A\+R\+L N\+U\+L\+L expression (not J\+A\+V\+A\textquotesingle{}s N\+U\+L\+L); 
\item a heap has the type $<$array-\/of-\/array-\/of-\/\+T1, array-\/of-\/array-\/of-\/\+T2, ...$>$, corresponding to malloc statements and handle objects used in the model; 
\item a heap field has the type array-\/of-\/array-\/of-\/\+T; 
\item a heap object has the type array of type T, which is allocated/deallocated by malloc(handle create)/deallocate(handle destroy) methods; 
\item a heap atomic object has the type T, and is an element of a certain heap object; 
\item a heap memory unit is a pointer to a heap object, which has type pointer-\/to-\/array-\/of-\/\+T, and has the form {\ttfamily \&di\$heap$<$j,k$>$}, where {\ttfamily i} is the dyscope I\+D of the heap, {\ttfamily j} is the index of the heap field that the heap object belongs to, and {\ttfamily k} is the index of the heap object in the heap field. 
\item a heap pointer is any pointer pointing to some part of the heap.
