From 2.0 to 2.1:
  Start using structs with pointers, a simpler version of what was in the first version
  Make functions for methods that are the same in every iteration
  
Done:
  Crash on using pointers not malloc'd
  Crash on using wait without spawn

  Finished square.cvl 2.1
  
ToDo:
  life.cvl
  vecadd.cvl
  ReDo wiki
    Note that because methods are put in directly there is no need to build or open files
