This folder contains a sequential and a concurrent implementation of an
algorithm to find the maximum element in an array.

max.cvl: the driver
max_seq.cvl: the sequential implementation
max_par.cvl: the concurrent implementation (with data races)

CIVL finds that the two versions are not equivalent.
