Stable releases: each with complete distributions or just jar,
different OS types

Unstable release: just give the latest, complete distribution and
just the civl jar.

Process for unstable latest: automate in build script
  ant should do "release" target: create directory called
  "release" with whatever you want, copy it over. waste.

worker should perform perl substitutions, bundle everything
up into one directory called build-r256 (e.g.)

preparing release: create directories, copy jar and dependencies,
create symlinks, tar, gzip

prepare stable release: goes in tags, leave out revision number

how to tell which version you are in.  Put in repository a file
called VERSION.  That is it.

Stable: leave off r part.  put in tags directory
