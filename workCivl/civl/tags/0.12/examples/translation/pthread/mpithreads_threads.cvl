/*****************************************************************************
* SOURCE: This is a translation of a Pthread program from the Lawrence Livermore
* Computing Center POSIX Threads Programming Exercise at:
* https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/pthreads/exercise.html
* FILE: mpithreads_threads.cvl
* DESCRIPTION:
*   This simple program illustrates the use of Pthreads in a program obtained
*   by modifying a serial code that performs a dot product. It is the second
*   of four codes used to show the progression from a serial program to a
*   hybrid MPI/Pthreads program.  The other relevant codes are:
*      - mpithreads_serial.c   - The serial version
*      - mpithreads_mpi.c - A distributed memory programming model with MPI
*      - mpithreads_both.c - A hybrid model that utilizes both MPI and
*          Pthreads to execute on systems that are comprised of clusters
*          of SMP's.
*   The main data is made available to all threads through a globally 
*   accessible structure. Each thread works on a different part of the 
*   data.  The main thread waits for all the threads to complete their 
*   computations, and then it prints the resulting sum.
* Command line execution:
* civl verify -inputMAXTHRDS=8 -inputVECLEN=100 mpithreads_thread.cvl

this argument is a thread number. All the other information required by the

The main program creates threads which do all the work and then print out

mutual exclusion. The main thread needs to wait for all threads to complete, 
it waits for each one of the threads. We specify a thread attribute value 
that allow the main thread to join with the threads it creates. Note also 
that we free up handles  when they are no longer needed.
