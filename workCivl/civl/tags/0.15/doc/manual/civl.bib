	Abstract = {VCC is an industrial-strength verification environment for low-level concurrent system code written in C. VCC takes a program (annotated with function contracts, state assertions, and type invariants) and attempts to prove the correctness of these annotations. It includes tools for monitoring proof attempts and constructing partial counterexample executions for failed proofs. This paper motivates VCC, describes our verification methodology, describes the architecture of VCC, and reports on our experience using VCC to verify the Microsoft Hyper-V hypervisor.},
