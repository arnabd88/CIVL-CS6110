ModelFactory.java: reading by S.F. Siegel on 2/27/2013. 


it would help if the general comment contained some guide
as to how to use the methods to build a model.  In particular,
in what order are things called?  (Scopes first, then 
functions, then ,..., finally model).

the argument to scope takes the Function to which the scope belongs.
However, isn't the function determined by the parent scope?
I forget exactly how this works.   I think there are certain
scopes which are "function scopes" which belong to a particular
function f.  It isn't clear me to how to use this---do I produce
the function first, and then the scope to go with it...???
Maybe there needs to be more than one method here?
