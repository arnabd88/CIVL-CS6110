buildModel: would it make more sense to iterate over the
entities of the AST rather than over the nodes?  Entities
provide a more abstract interface.  You can iterate over all
the variables, then over all the functions for examples.  
A single function may have multiple external definition nodes
associated to it, because there could be multiple declarations and
one definition.  Maybe you want to translate the types first
by getting all the types from the typefactory.

in buildModel, "if (node instanceof VariableDeclarationNode) ...":
consider using switch on the node kind instead of the sequence
of if...else if...

line 176, "processVariableDeclaration(system.outerScope(),
						(VariableDeclarationNode) rootNode.child(i));":
"rootNode.child(i)" can be replaced by "node"
						
consider making processVariableDeclaration return the Variable it
creates.  Then in method buildModel, you can get rid of this:
"system.outerScope().getVariable(system.outerScope().numVariables() - 1)"
because you will already have the Variable that was just created.

in buildModel line 187 "right = expression((ExpressionNode) init,
							system.outerScope());",
this assumes the initializer is an ExpressionNode.  It might be
a compound initializer instead.

when you need to iterate over elements of a map, as here:
"for (CallStatement statement : callStatements.keySet()) {
			statement
					.setFunction(functionMap.get(callStatements.get(statement)));
}"

It is more effecient to iterate over the (Entry)s of the map:

for (Entry<X,Y> entry : callStatements.entrySet()) {
  .... entry.getKey() .... entry.getValue() ...
}

"if (typeNode.kind() == TypeNodeKind.BASIC) { ..." : again, in place of
long sequence of if else if..., use switch

"if (typeNode.kind() == TypeNodeKind.STRUCTURE_OR_UNION) {..." : the ABC node
could be a structure or union, but translator assumes it is structure.
Even if unions are not (yet) supported, throw an exception saying so rather
that mis-translate it as struct.

in method expression "if (expression instanceof OperatorNode) {..."
replace with switch on NodeKind.
