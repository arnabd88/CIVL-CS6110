/**
 * An absolute deadlock occurs if all of the following hold:
 * 
 * <ol>
 * <li>not every process has terminated
 * <li>no process has an enabled statement (note that a send statement is
 * enabled iff the current number of buffered messages is less than the buffer
 * bound).
 * </ol>
 * 
 * It is to be contrasted with a "potentially deadlocked" state, i.e., one in
 * which there may be send transitions enabled, but the send transitions can
 * only execute if buffering is allowed, i.e., no matching receives are
 * currently posted. Every absolutely deadlocked state is potentially
 * deadlocked, but not necessarily vice-versa.
