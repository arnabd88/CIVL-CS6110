                   How to release a new version of CIVL

1. Working with your local copy of trunk, make sure all tests pass.

2. Edit the fields named "version" and "date" in interface
edu.udel.cis.vsl.civl.config.CIVLConstants to use the new version and today's date.
Also, edit README to change the version number and the changes of 
the new version. Updates CIVL manual accordingly (there is also version number and
date referenced in the manual, and they need to be consistent with the release).

3. Commit your trunk or make sure there are no uncommitted
modifications.

4. Create the tag: to create version 0.2, for example:

svn copy svn://vsl.cis.udel.edu/civl/trunk svn://vsl.cis.udel.edu/civl/tags/0.2
 
5. On vsl.cis.udel.edu, sudo su svn, and edit
/home/svn/repositories/civl/hooks/post-commit by changing the second 
argument of the build_and_test.sh command to refer to the new version of 
the release (e.g., 0.14).

6. The autotest script will create the release at the next CIVL commit
(to any part of CIVL). If you don't want to wait, you can trigger it
manually by executing from vsl, in ~/scripts/autotest:

 ./build_and_test.sh CIVL $version civl $rev

where $version is the new version number for release and $rev is 
whatever the revision number was for the release, e.g.,
 ./build_and_test.sh CIVL 0.13 civl 1580

You can also type “./build_and_test.sh help” for the usage of the script.

7. If there are any problems, you can continue to modify the branch.
For example, to incorporate changes from the trunk, update or check
out a fresh local copy of the whole project, change into the branch
directory, and type svn merge svn://vsl.cis.udel.edu/civl/trunk See
the Subversion Book for details on merging changes. Then commit these
changes as usual. After each commit, autotest should run automatically
and produce the new release. Here is an example:

First, check out the tagged branch somewhere:
  svn co svn://vsl.cis.udel.edu/civl/tags/0.4
Second, go to the directory you download:
  cd 0.4
Third, merge changes from the trunk:
  svn merge svn://vsl.cis.udel.edu/civl/trunk
Forth, commit:
  svn ci -m"Merged updated README from trunk."

8. Test the release: download it from the web page, move the
executable file "civl" somewhere in your path (e.g., /tools/bin)
and execute it on an example, e.g., "civl verify examples/barrier.cvl".

9. Update Trac milestones: go to https://vsl.cis.udel.edu/trac/civl/,
log in, click on Roadmap, click on the milestone name (v0.2, for
example), and edit it to indicate completed. You can also indicate
that open tickets for that milestone be pushed to the next milestone.
Update other milestones (for example, pushing the dates forward) as
desired.

10. Update default milestone/version: go to https://vsl.cis.udel.edu/trac/civl/,
log in, click on Admin, click on Milestones, choose a new milestone as the default,
click Apply changes. Ditto for setting the default version.

11. Send an email to civl-dev and civl-users announcing the new release.
