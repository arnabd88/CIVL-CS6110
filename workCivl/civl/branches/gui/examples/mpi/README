These are some MPI programs.  Our goal is to get civl to verify these 
exactly as they are, translating them automatically to CIVL-C.  

routines directory contains simple mpi examples which are mainly used
to test our implementation of mpi routines

dev directory contains mpi examples that are under development

seq directory contains sequential versions of the corresponding
mpi examples.
