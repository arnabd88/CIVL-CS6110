Key concept is one of independence of code executed in "omp parallel" scopes
 - a block of (non-pragma enclosed code) can be independent if
   it references only private or per-thread data
 - "for" can be independent if loop is dependence-free
 - "sections" is independent if the contained sections are 
   mutually independent
 - "single", "master", "critical" are independent by definition
 - "barrier" divides code before and after into portions whose
   independence can be reasoned about separately
 -> "parallel" is independent if ALL subconstructs are independent

Strategies for computing independence
 - overapproximate dependence - if there is none then its independent
 - precise dependence tracking, e.g., symbolic execution
   - note that this really should be demand-driven and targetted at
     shared data

Systematic analysis of constructs
 - "omp for"
   - sync -> breaks regions into before and after
 - "omp for nowait"
 - "omp master", "omp single", "omp atomic"
   - a single thread executes within block
   - no sync on entry or exit
   - atomic has a very restricted form
 - "omp critical"
   - one thread at a time in the block
   - no sync on entry or exit
 - "omp barrier"
   - sync -> breaks regions into before and after
 - "omp sections"
 - "omp section"

Treatment of omp_* calls
 - when simplifying a construct to remove parallelism
   - replace omp_get_thread_num() with "0"
   - replace omp_get_num_threads() with "1"
   - how should other calls be handled?
     - conservatively we can prevent simplification if other calls
       are present

Clauses
 - "if", "num_threads" 
   - these can be ignored, we check unconditional independence of workshares
 - privacy-related
   - must be processed to accurately compute dependences

Deferred until later
 - "omp taskwait"
 - "omp taskgroup"
 - "omp flush"
 - "omp ordered"
