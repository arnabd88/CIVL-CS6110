/**
 * <p>
 * An instance of Type represents a C type. A type is a conceptual entity, not a
 * syntactic element. This class is the root of the type hierarchy for all types
 * used to represent C types.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * There may also be additional types that are not part of C, but are part of
 * some extension to C (such as CIVL-C).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Summary of type hierarchy:
 * </p>
 * 
 * {@link Type}
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link FunctionType}
 * <li>{@link ObjectType}
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link UnqualifiedObjectType}
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link ArithmeticType}</li>
 * <li>{@link ArrayType}</li>
 * <li>{@link AtomicType}</li>
 * <li>{@link StandardBasicType}</li>
 * <li>etc.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>{@link QualifiedObjectType}
 * <ul>
 * <li>uses one or more of <code>const</code>, <code>volatile</code>,
 * <code>restrict</code>, etc.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note: {@link AtomicType} and {@link QualifiedObjectType} constructors take an
 * {@link UnqualifiedObjectType}.
 * </p>
 * 
 * 
 * <p>
 * Equivalence relations: there are 3 equivalence relations on the set of types.
 * From strongest to weakest, they are: equality, equivalence, and
 * compatibility. If T1 equals (according to the equals method) T2, then T1 is
 * also equivalent to T2. If T1 is equivalent to T2 then T1 is compatible with
 * T2.
 * <p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The differences mainly involve tagged entities (structs, unions, enums). In
 * C, it is possible for two structs (for example) to have the same tag, fields,
 * and field types, but still represent two distinct types. This happens if they
 * are declared in two different scopes. Hence it is necessary to specify some
 * other "hidden" component of a struct type to determine when two are equal. We
 * call this the "key": this is any Object, whose "equals" method is used to
 * determine when two tagged types are equal. For any key, there can be at most
 * one struct type using that key. Hence two structs are equal if and only if
 * their keys are equal. Since there can be only one struct object with that
 * key, it follows that they are ==. This invariant is enforced by the type
 * factory.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Two structs which are not equal may still be "equivalent". This means they
 * have equal tags (equal as strings), and, they are either both complete or
 * both incomplete. If they are complete, they must have equivalent fields with
 * the same names and in the same order.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Two structs which are not equal may nevertheless be "compatible". An
 * incomplete struct with tag T is compatible with any struct with tag T. An
 * incomplete array type is compatible with a complete array type which has a
 * compatible element type.
 * </p>
