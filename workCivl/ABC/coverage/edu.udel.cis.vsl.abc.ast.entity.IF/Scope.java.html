/**
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A lexical (static) scope in a translation unit. The C11 Standard specifies 4
 * kinds of scopes: FILE, BLOCK, FUNCTION, and FUNCTION_PROTOTYPE.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * 
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A scope contains declarations of various kinds of entities. An &quot;entity&quot; is
 * any conceptual thing which can be named using an identifier. An entity may be
 * declared in more than one scope (though the process of &quot;linkage&quot;).
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * 
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Global declarations are in the FILE scope. A BLOCK scope corresponds to a
 * block. The BLOCK scope corresponding to a function body includes the formal
 * parameters as well as the outermost local parameters. The only entities with
 * FUNCTION scope are (standard) labels---the labels that can be used as a
 * target of a &quot;goto&quot; statement. A FUNCTION_PROTOTYPE scope occurs only in a
 * function prototype, i.e., a function delcaration without body; such a scope
 * extends to the end of the declarator for the function prototype.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * 
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The set of all scopes in a translation unit forms a tree. The root of the
 * tree is the FILE scope.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * 
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * There are four kinds of name spaces in a scope: (1) the label namespace,
 * which consists of all the (standard) label names in the scope; (2) the tag
 * namespace, which consists of all the tags used in struct, union, and
 * enumeration definitions; (3) the &quot;member&quot; namespaces (one namespace for each
 * struct or union containing the field names for that struct or union); and (4)
 * the namespace for &quot;ordinary identifiers&quot;---those declared in an ordinary (not
 * struct or union) declarator, or as an enumeration constant---, this includes
 * typedef names, variables, and functions. For example, the same identifier &quot;X&quot;
 * could be used to denote a label, the tag of a struct, a member of that
 * struct, and a variable, all in the same scope. However, &quot;X&quot; could not denote
 * both a variable and a function in the same scope; nor could it denote both a
 * struct tag and an enumeration tag in the same scope; but two different
 * structs in the same scope can both have a field named &quot;X&quot;.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * 
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Ordinary entities include: functions, variables (that are not fields),
 * enumeration constants, and typedefs.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * 
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Note that &quot;label&quot; means standard label: the kind that is specified by an
 * identifier followed by a colon. Not a &quot;case label&quot; (CASE followed by a
 * constant expression then colon, used in switch statements), and not the
 * &quot;default&quot; label (also used in switch statements).
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * 
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Note: Entities can have no name. It is OK if two distinct entities have no
 * name; they are not the same entity. It is as if each is given a new name
 * distinct from all other names.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
