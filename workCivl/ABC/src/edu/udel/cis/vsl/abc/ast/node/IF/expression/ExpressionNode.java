/**
 * <p>
 * A node representing any kind of C expression. This is the root of a type
 * hierarchy of expression nodes.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This interface extends {@link InitializerNode} because an expression can be
 * used as an initializer for a scalar variable.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This interface extends {@link SizeableNode} because an expression can be used
 * as an argument to the <code>sizeof</code> operator.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This interface extends {@link ForLoopInitializerNode} to indicate that an
 * expression can be used as the first clause of a "<code>for</code>" loop (as
 * can a variable declaration).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * There are many different subtypes of this interface, for the different kinds
 * of expressions. An enumerated type {@link ExpressionKind} is provided to make
 * it easy to identify the subtype and, for example, <code>switch</code> on it.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Every expression has an initial type, and then some number (possibly 0) of
 * implicit conversions. Each conversion specifies an old type and a new type.
 * The conversions form a chain: the first conversion (conversion number 0) has
 * as its old type the initial type of the expression. The old type of
 * conversion n (for any n&ge;1) equals the new type of conversion n-1. The new
 * type of the last conversion is the final "converted type" of the expression.
