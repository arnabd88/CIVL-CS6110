/**
 * <p>
 * Root of the AST node type hierarchy. All AST nodes implement this interface.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * An AST node has some number <i>n</i> of <strong>children</strong>. Each child
 * is either an AST node or <code>null</code>. The children are arranged in an
 * ordered sequences and numbered from 0.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Every AST node has at most one parent. If a node <i>u</i> has a (non-
 * <code>null</code>) parent <i>v</i>, then it is guaranteed that <i>u</i> is a
 * child of <i>v</i>. This class is designed so that it is not possible to
 * violate these invariants.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Nodes are mutable objects. It is possible to modify various aspects of the
 * node, to remove a node from its parent, to add new children to a node, and so
 * on.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * At any point in time, a node is either "owned" by an AST or it is "free". A
 * node can be owned by at most one AST. A node starts out as free, and becomes
 * owned by an AST when an AST is created and the node is reachable from the
 * root node used to create the new AST. The nodes of an AST can become free by
 * "releasing" the AST, which essentially disolves the AST but leaves the nodes
 * intact. Modifications to the tree structure (the parent and child relations)
 * can only occur on free nodes, hence to modify an AST it is necessary to first
 * release it. After the modifications are complete, a new AST can be formed
 * from the modified nodes.
